    "text": "Hospitals and laboratories in Denmark have a significant potential for saving electricity on lighting, ventilation, and laboratory equipment. Danish hospitals consume around 1,500 GWh of energy annually, with 90% of the regions' energy expenses going to hospitals. Energy-intensive equipment like blood and DNA analysis apparatus, freezers, fume hoods, ventilation, and cooling are the biggest energy consumers. \n\nA study at Odense University Hospital showed that laboratory equipment, X-ray machines, and scanners with associated cooling and ventilation could be switched off outside working hours. Many large devices such as CT and MRI scanners utilize over 75% of their energy in standby mode. Hospitals can significantly reduce energy consumption by analyzing and possibly switching off or putting equipment on standby mode outside working hours.\n\nTo identify unnecessary energy consumption at night, hospitals can measure electricity usage and conduct night rounds to monitor energy consumption. Recommendations to reduce electricity use include installing temperature sensors in rooms with cooling equipment and connecting them to the ventilation systemâ€™s CTS, installing motion sensors in corridors and laboratories, and using automation to close hatches automatically if there is no movement. Hospitals can benefit from establishing colder rooms, producing warmer cooling water, and opting for water cooling over air cooling.\n\nThere is also an emphasis on energy-efficient purchasing practices for hospitals and laboratories. Hospitals are encouraged to demand energy-efficient equipment in procurement and engage with suppliers on energy-saving measures. Furthermore, the guide advises on specifying the ability to shut down larger hospital equipment in procurement and requiring manuals for clinicians to automate standby as much as possible.\n\nFurther steps include focusing on energy-efficient purchases of medical equipment, the renovation or replacement of ventilation systems with VAV systems, and introducing energy management in hospitals. Energy management can lead to substantial energy savings through minor investments and behavioral changes. Energy management also helps coordinate energy-saving efforts across departments and establish responsibilities for driving energy efficiency within the organization.\n\nEnergistyrelsen offers guidance and tools for hospitals and laboratories to achieve energy efficiency through measures like energy-saving procurement, efficient ventilations systems, and energy management practices. Overall, the goal is to help hospitals reduce energy consumption and costs while promoting sustainable energy practices.",
